# C++ Lessons

Each lesson has its own folder with its own code and own build script.
I suggest cloning this so you can view it in a text editor like VS Code.

## Build Instructions
For windows users
------
1. Install the LATEST version of Visual Studio 2019 community edition
2. Make sure the "Desktop Development with C++" module is installed
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the cpp-lessons folder
4. run this command `setupenv`, this will setup the c++ compiler and must be done every time you want to compile c++ code from a new CMD
5. run `buildall` to then build all the lessons
6. to build an individual lesson navigate to lesson folder and then run `build`
