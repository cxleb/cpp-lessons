# C++ Lessons

Each lesson has its own folder with its own code and own build script.
I suggest cloning this so you can view it in a text editor like VS Code.

## The 13 Lessons, with no so serious names
1. why is c++ so hard to compile
2. what is a header file and why the fuck do they exist
3. cpp is just java but better and harder
4. data types? why do they mean nothing?
5. what is a pointer and why are they great
6. your the garbage man now
7. what is a reference and why are they fucked
8. classes? structs? what the fuck
9. what is this c you talk about and why does it matter
10. ok, c++ standard library or c standard library?
11. what the fuck is STL
12. operator overloading? excuse me
13. ok give me a break

## Build Instructions
For windows users
------
1. Install the LATEST version of Visual Studio 2019 community edition
2. Make sure the "Desktop Development with C++" module is installed
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the cpp-lessons folder
4. run this command `setupenv`, this will setup the c++ compiler and must be done every time you want to compile c++ code from a new CMD
5. run `buildall` to then build all the lessons
6. to build an individual lesson navigate to lesson folder and then run `build`
