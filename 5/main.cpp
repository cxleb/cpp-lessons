    Lesson 5 - what is a pointer and why are they great

    oh boy, pointers

    A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address as its value
    - w3schools.com

    A pointer is basically a variable which "points" to another "variable"
    or block of memory. 
    
    But why? In java we didnt have to deal with them? and your telling me 
    theyre great?

    Theyre great because they allow for very specific control over memory,
    what variable your changing, weather your copying by reference or by 
    value in a function and generally allow more control over your code.

    so lets just run throw some example code

int main(int argc, const char** argv)
{
    return 0;
