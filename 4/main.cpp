    Lesson 4 - data types? why do they mean nothing?

    ok, so now we covered simple c++ and hows its similar, we covered
    why c++ is a pain to compile and write headers for.

    Now lets get into some history.

    PREPROCESSORS, love em or hate the, theyre a cool feature of c++.
    the idea with a preprocessor is it is a special bit of code that
    changes the way c++ works.

    what? i know what your thinking zoe

    so we have been using some preprocessors already

    #include - includes a file into your compilation unit, doesnt have to 
            be a header file
    #pragma - compiler directive, can be used for a bunch of stuff, commonly
    

    they all start with a hashtag and they do some funky stuff
